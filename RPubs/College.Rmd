## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading dataset}
library(AER)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(DataExplorer)
data(CollegeDistance)
```

```{r select fields, echo=FALSE}
selected_fields <-
  CollegeDistance %>% 
  select(score, urban, distance, tuition, education)
```

```{r explore data, echo=FALSE}
create_report(selected_fields)
```

```{r checking multicollinearity, echo=FALSE}
plot(CollegeDistance[c(3,10, 11)])
```

```{r checking multicollinearity1, echo=FALSE}
plot(CollegeDistance[c(3,10, 11)])
```

```{r correlation matrices, echo=FALSE}
#less than 0.9, so no multicollinearity
CollegeDistance %>% 
  select(score, distance, tuition) %>% 
  cor()

#Calculate the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)
# Dataset should have VIF >10 to have multicollinearty
score <- lm(score ~ distance + tuition, data = CollegeDistance)
1/(1-summary(score)$r.squared)

```

```{r plotting, echo=FALSE}
plot(CollegeDistance$score, CollegeDistance$education, xlab = "Years of Education", ylab = "Achievement Test Score", pch = as.numeric(CollegeDistance$urban))

newscore <- jitter(CollegeDistance$score, factor = 2) # Adding some noise
newed <- jitter(CollegeDistance$education, factor = 2) # Adding some noise
plot(newscore, newed, xlab = "Years of Education", ylab = "Achievement Test Score", pch = as.numeric(CollegeDistance$urban))

```

```{r model building, echo=FALSE}
starting.model <- lm(education ~ score + urban + distance + tuition, data = CollegeDistance)
simple.model <- lm(education ~ 1, data = CollegeDistance)
stepAIC(starting.model, scope = list(upper = starting.model, lower = simple.model), direction = "backward")

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
